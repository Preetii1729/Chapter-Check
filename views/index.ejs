            <h2>Books I've read!!</h2>
            This page entails <b>my</b> notes/thoughts about the books I've read for a really longgg time. Fair warning: It is not meant to hurt or offend anyone, as I said these are my opnions, and the special thing about books is that we can all have our own interpretation and thoughts about them. So, I would urge everyone reading to not take this personally. <br>
            Additionally I would like to to add that I cannot gurantee good recommendations, I am quite weird! So if there is something I've liked I am not sure whether or not you will like it too. (More likely you won't lol). <br>
            If you find it hard to keep track all of books you have read, you can also add your review here! If you want to find it again you can just search your name in review authors.
